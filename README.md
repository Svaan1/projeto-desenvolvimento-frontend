# Spotify Game Guesser

Small project focused on creating a spotify song game guesser, powered by [`svelte`](https://svelte.dev/).

# Pre-requisites
- < `npm` or `yarn` > 
- < Svelte >
- < Some IDE or vscode >

## Clone project
You know the drill

```bash
# Start by cloning the project in the desired directory
git clone https://github.com/MatheusMotizuki/spotify-guess
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `npm i` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> In case of any bugs, good luck :)
